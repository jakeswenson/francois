{"name":"François","tagline":"A better jenkins, because it's french!","body":"François\r\n=====\r\n\r\nFrançois is a dropwizard.io api and web application for templatizing jenkins jobs. François is available as a docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/onoffswitch/francois/\r\nThe app deploys to the port `9090` with its dropwizard admin port on `9099`. \r\nAll templates are stored and tracked using jenkins views, so no external database is required.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n===\r\n\r\nFrancois gets its running configuration from either its configuration yaml file (configuration.yml) or the environment. \r\n\r\nThe following environment variables are avaiable\r\n\r\n- `JENKINS_URL`: this should point to your jenkins machine. example: `http://jenkins.jakeswenson.github.com/`\r\n- `JENKINS_USER`: this is the user created to manage jenkins and create jobs. example: `francois`\r\n- `JENKINS_TOKEN`: this should be the user token for that jenkins user above. You can get this from the users jenkins configuration page.\r\n\r\nFrancois useses two views to manage all available tempaltes and templatized jobs:\r\n\r\n- `Templates` and \r\n- `Templatized` so create them in your jenkins instance.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter what type of view they are, but it's simplest to create list views.\r\n\r\nUsing the docker image\r\n=====\r\n\r\nRun the docker image with:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -it \\ \r\n    -e JENKINS_URL='http://jenkins.jakeswenson.github.com/' \\\r\n    -e JENKINS_USER=francois \\\r\n    -e JENKINS_TOKEN=USER_JENKINS_TOKEN \\\r\n    -p 9090:9090 \\\r\n    -p 9099:9099 \\\r\n    -v `pwd`/logs/core:/data/logs \\\r\n    onoffswitch/francois\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding your own container\r\n=====\r\n\r\nUse: \r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean package\r\n\r\n./scripts/run-core.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaking changes to the UI\r\n=====\r\n\r\nFrançois UI is built with Angular2 and typescript. make sure you have typscript installed:\r\n```\r\nsudo npm install --global typescript\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then install the dependencies:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease file any issues you might find.
